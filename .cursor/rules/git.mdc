# GIT CONVENTIONS

## Commit Messages
Follow Conventional Commits:
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation only
- `style:` - Formatting, no code change
- `refactor:` - Code restructuring
- `test:` - Adding tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance

**Format:** `type(scope): description`

**Examples:**
```
feat(projects/website): add contact form
fix(shared/utils): handle null values
docs: update README with new structure
```

## Branch Naming
- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `refactor/description` - Refactoring
- `docs/description` - Documentation

## Workflow
1. Create branch from `main`
2. Make changes
3. Commit with conventional messages
4. Push and create PR
5. After merge, delete branch

## Best Practices
- Commit often, push daily
- Keep commits atomic (one logical change)
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Reference issues: `fix: resolve #123`
